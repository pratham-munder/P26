Pav Bhaji is a native Maharashtrian dish made with an assortment of mashed vegetables, pan-fried on a large tawa and served with Pav toasted in butter. It is immensely popular all across the country because of its spicy and tangy zest. The generous dose of butter that is often used with freshly-cut onions and lemon juice tops the dish. Pav Bhaji is also a great way to feed fussy kids their share of veggies with a smile! You can also serve Pav Bhaji in a bruschetta/canap√© style for your next party.
